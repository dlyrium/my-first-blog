<h1>Tutorial Stuff</h1>
<p>Things I've essentially copied from tutorials, sometimes modifying things here and there.</p>
<h2><a href="/blog" class="blog">Blog App</a></h2>

<h1>Home-brew Stuff</h1>
<p>Apps I've made entirely myself, or tutorials I've since modified so extensively that I'm content calling them
    'home made' as I know how they work inside out.</p>
